TEST TASKS SUMMARY:

1. Fix game character movement physics:
+    1.1. Game character shouldn't be able to go out of the game frame.
+    1.2. Game character should be able to move left-right via pressing "left/right" arrow keys on the keyboard.

2. Rework shooting mechanism (available via pressing Shift key):
+    2.1. Make initial speed for each shooting different (within reasonable limits)
+    2.2. Add some gravitation influence for fired projectile. Direct flying is too boring :)

3. Define enemy behavior:
+    3.1. Enemy should move automatically left-right inside the game frame.
+    3.2. Periodically the enemy should shoot towards direction of his movement.

4. Change conditions for victory:
+    4.1. Demo condition is already implemented (shoot left side of game field to win). 
     It should be replaced by another condition: enemy should be killed.

5. Implement conditions of death of game character and enemy:
+    5.1. Player should death on intersection with any fired projectile.
+    5.2. Enemy also should death on the same intersection with any fired projectile.
